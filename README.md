#Laundry of the Future
######by Alex Biedny, Peter Linden, Jeremy Wood
   
A smart washer and dryer. Users can select preset wash/dry cycles, or create their own custom ones under their profiles. Any alerts from the washer or dryer send the user a text, and the status of each machine is displayed on the web app. The web app is used to control the machines and user profiles. The washer and dryer also have physical stop buttons, an LED light indicating the washer temperature, and a buzzer that sounds when a cycle is complete.
