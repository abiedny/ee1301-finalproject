        <h1>Welcome, User One</h1>
            <p>Not sure what the user pages should do</p>
            <p>Putting a "create new cycle" button where users can create wash or dry cycles that belong to them</p>
            <p>Then those will be displayed on the this page, along with like user settings if thats neccesary</p>
            <p>Gonna preload it with each user having like two or three custom cycles</p>
